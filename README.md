## Principles of Collaboration

**All data and code shared here is subject to the [Eyewire II Principles of Collaboration](https://eyewire.ai/principles).** By the use of this repository, you agree to be bound by these Principles.

# Eyewire II: Functional data

This repository hosts the functional data from OGB-1 recordings in the Eyewire II dataset.

This is work-in-progress and currently holds:
- pre-processed calcium traces from recordings over five recording fields, stored as [parquet files](data/preprocessed-data/)
- morphological data (proofread cell master list, 2P-to-EM ROI mapping) in [data/morphological-data/](data/morphological-data/)
- tutorial notebooks to [plot raw traces](notebooks/tutorial/plot_raw_data/plot_raw_data.ipynb) and [plot a data overview](notebooks/tutorial/plot_data_overview/plot_data_overview.ipynb)

Documentation is still incomplete:
- a description of the preprocessed data can be found [here](data/preprocessed-data/README.md).
- a description of the stimuli can be found [here](data/stimuli/README.md).

Feel free to open issues to ask questions and request features!

### Setup

To use the code in this repository out of the box, you can use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to reproduce our python environment. Follow these steps:

- Install `uv`
- Clone this repository and navigate to its root folder
- Run `uv run jupyter lab` to start jupyter lab  - it should open in your browser, and allows you to run our notebooks.

On the first call, `uv run` will install all dependencies into a `uv` virtual environment (placed in the `.venv` folder), which is then invoked on all further calls of `uv run`.

### Loading the data

All data loading is handled by `eyewire2_functional_analysis.data_loader`. The easiest way to load all three DataFrames at once is:

```python
from eyewire2_functional_analysis import data_loader

data_folder = "data/preprocessed-data"

df_rois, df_fields, df_outline = data_loader.load_all_dfs(data_folder)
```

You can also load each DataFrame individually using `load_df_rois()`, `load_df_fields()`, or `load_df_outline()`.

To merge the ROI-level data with the morphological master spreadsheet:

```python
morph_folder = "data/morphological-data"
version = "2026-03-17"  # replace with the date of your master list

df_rois_morph = data_loader.load_df_rois_morph(
    morph_folder=morph_folder,
    morph_spreadsheet_filename=f"Eyewire II Proofread Cells Master List - All Cells {version}.csv",
    nuc_col_master="Final NucID",
    seg_col_master="Final SegID",
    data_folder=data_folder,
)
```

See the tutorial notebooks for full usage examples:
- [plot_raw_data.ipynb](notebooks/tutorial/plot_raw_data/plot_raw_data.ipynb) — load data and plot raw + preprocessed traces for individual ROIs
- [plot_data_overview.ipynb](notebooks/tutorial/plot_data_overview/plot_data_overview.ipynb) — plot chirp and bar response overviews grouped by cell type and recording field
- [plot_morph_and_func.ipynb](notebooks/tutorial/plot_morphology/plot_morph_and_func.ipynb) — plot morphology and functional data for individual cells
